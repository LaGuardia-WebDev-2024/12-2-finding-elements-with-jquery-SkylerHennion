## Directions

### Step #1 - Replace the list items <br>

This webpage displays some basic information about horses. You'll use jQuery to replace parts of the page so that it's all about unicorns instead! In this first step, use jQuery to change the text of all of the `<li>`s to **'horn'.**
<br><br>
_Hint:_`$("li").text(_)`
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Replace the headline <br>
Now use jQuery to replace the main headline, selecting it based on its page-heading id. Change it so that this page is **'All about unicorns'** instead.
<br><br>
_Hint:_`$(_).text(_)`

### Step #3 - Replace the animal names <br>
Finally, use jQuery to select all of the `<span>`s that have the class name animal and change their text to say **'unicorns'** instead.

_Hint:_`$(_).text(_)`
